6. Changes:

On Friday, I read more deeply into the grading rubric and refactored my code to include the element list. 
It was the only way I could see avoiding many if statements. 

7. Assumptions:

I assumed the names of the characters, as well as their skill sets.
I also assumed they could have negative scores if they were cursed.

8. Limitations:
    You cannot pick your weapons or name your own characters.
